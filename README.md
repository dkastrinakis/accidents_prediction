# Accidents_prediction - Personal Project

## Information about the Dataset
The data used in this report relate to the circumstances of road accidents in the UK in 2018. The specific dataset is a subset of the original data retrieved from the UK Department for Transport website. Only a subset of the provided data is being used that provide less complicated information than the original dataset, but at the same time it is as useful for the purposes of this report.

## Business Objective
The goal is to create a parsimonious, adequate and good model that will enable a road assistance company to forecast the number of accidents in the UK per hour and hence allocate its resources accordingly. Hence, the number of accidents will constitute this report's target variable. In doing so, an ARIMA time series model, along with a RandomForest regressor and a support vector regressor will be built and compared in deciding which model is the most accurate in predicting the target variable.
